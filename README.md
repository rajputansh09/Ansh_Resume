🎓 I'm a 3rd-year Software Engineering Co-op Student at the University of Alberta with a deep passion for building innovative, real-world tech solutions. Whether it's crafting sleek front-end designs, diving into C++ for game development, or optimizing back-end logic in Python and Bash, I love turning ideas into impactful experiences. 💡

📚 I've applied my skills in professional co-op roles—conducting research, streamlining quality systems, and enhancing digital workflows. Proficient in Python, C++, HTML/CSS, Bash, and MATLAB, and experienced with tools like Git, VS Code, and 3D prototyping, I thrive in both collaborative and independent settings. 💻🛠️

🌍 Fluent in English, Hindi, Punjabi, and Urdu, with international exposure and a multicultural mindset, I'm also WHMIS certified and trained in Engineering Safety Leadership. 🎮 Game development is my dream path, and I'm actively building projects and leveling up every day. 🚀 Let’s code something awesome!
